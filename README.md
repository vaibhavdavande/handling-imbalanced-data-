Introduction
If you have spent some time in machine learning and data science, you would have definitely come across imbalanced class distribution. This is a scenario where the number of observations belonging to one class is significantly lower than those belonging to the other classes.

This problem is predominant in scenarios where anomaly detection is crucial like electricity pilferage, fraudulent transactions in banks, identification of rare diseases, etc. In this situation, the predictive model developed using conventional machine learning algorithms could be biased and inaccurate.

This happens because Machine Learning Algorithms are usually designed to improve accuracy by reducing the error. Thus, they do not take into account the class distribution / proportion or balance of classes.
Here in this repository we will deal with the credit card dataset and illustrate how to handle the imbalanced data to improve the accuracy of the model
